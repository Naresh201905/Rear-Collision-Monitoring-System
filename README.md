# Rear Collision Monitoring with Alerting System 
 
## Overview 
This Python project detects potential rear-end collisions in vehicles using sensors and alerts the driver in real-time to prevent accidents. 
 
## Features 
- Real-time collision detection 
- Audio/visual alerts (buzzer and LEDs) 
- Dashboard display for distance from rear object 
- Easy to use and extendable 
 
## Technologies Used 
- Python 3 
- Arduino / Raspberry Pi 
- Ultrasonic / Proximity sensors 
- Buzzer, LEDs, optional LCD display 
 
## How It Works 
1. The sensor continuously measures the distance to the object behind the vehicle. 
2. If the distance falls below a safety threshold, an alert is triggered. 
3. Alerts include buzzer sound and LED indicators. 
4. Once the object moves away, the alert resets. 
 
## How to Run 
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed. 
2. Connect sensors (if using hardware). 
3. Run the project: 
``` 
python main.py 
``` 
 
## Future Improvements 
- Integration with automatic braking system 
- Mobile app dashboard for alerts 
- Multi-sensor array for wider detection coverage
